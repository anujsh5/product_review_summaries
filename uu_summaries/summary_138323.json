  "synopsis": "Reviewers often praise this kajal’s deep black payoff, smooth one‑stroke application, and budget‑friendly pricing. Many say it lasts for hours and doubles well as an eyeliner. However, a sizable number report smudging, fading within a few hours, and that it isn’t fully waterproof; a few also mention soft, break‑prone tips. Packaging and delivery experiences are generally positive.",
  "key_takeaways": [
    "Intense, jet-black color with strong pigmentation in one to two strokes.",
    "Smooth, creamy texture glides easily; can double as an eyeliner.",
    "Frequently described as long lasting and good value for money.",
    "Many users report smudging and limited wear time, not fully waterproof."
