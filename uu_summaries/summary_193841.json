  "synopsis": "Reviewers highlight a deep, jetâ€‘black payoff with smooth, oneâ€‘stroke application at a very affordable price. Many describe strong pigmentation and frequent repurchases, often noting good value during sales. Opinions diverge on wear: some report longâ€‘lasting, smudgeâ€‘resistant results, while others see transfer or fading within a few hours, especially on oily lids. Feedback on waterproofness and removal is mixed. A minority mention eye irritation or watery eyes, and a number report receiving broken tips or damaged units.",

    "Rich jetâ€‘black color with strong pigmentation and easy singleâ€‘stroke coverage",
    "Glides smoothly; many consider it budgetâ€‘friendly and good value on offers",
