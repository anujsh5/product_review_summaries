  "synopsis": "Reviews for Mamaearth Ubtan Face Wash with Turmeric & Saffron are largely positive. Many users report noticeable tan reduction and a healthy glow, often within a few uses. The cleanser is frequently described as a thick, paste-like formula with tiny exfoliating granules that cleanse well and can leave skin feeling fresh and soft. The saffron/turmeric scent is commonly noted as pleasant or mild. A number of reviewers highlight repeat purchases, while a smaller but recurring subset mention dryness, irritation, or breakouts, and some compare the texture to a scrub. Occasional comments cite non-foaming consistency, thicker dispensing, or packaging quirks.",
  "key_takeaways": [
    "Many note visible brightening and tan reduction within days of use",
    "Cleanses well, leaving skin feeling fresh, soft, and sometimes smoother",
    "Thick, paste-like formula with fine granules; doubles as mild exfoliation",
    "Some report scrub harshness, dryness, or breakouts; experience varies"
