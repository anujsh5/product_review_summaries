Several mention the low-lather formula needing more product, especially after oiling, and occasional stickiness if not rinsed well. A noticeable subset experienced dryness, frizz, or increased hair fall, and some cited leaks or faulty pumps on delivery.",
  "key_takeaways": [
    "Leaves hair feeling smoother and shinier for many regular users.",
    "Low-lather formula; may need extra product, particularly after oiling.",
    "Mild, pleasant fragrance frequently mentioned across positive reviews.",
